Matrix calculator for web browser

A simple matrix calculator for web or mobile browsers. The largest matrices you can create is 6x6, and decimal
inputs are allowed, with fraction input on its way. So far, the only operations available are multiplication, finding
the determinant and calculating the inverse matrix. The inverse matrix operation uses the cofactor matrix method. The next 
operation that I'm planning to implement is Guass Jordan elmination. The calcualtor can be viewed at [matrixcalc.ca](https://matrixcalc.ca/)
