Matrix Multiplier for web browser

A simple matrix multiplier for a web browser or mobile (but the formatting is  really bad)
The largest matrix you can create in 6x6, and negative numbers are allowed
but not fractions or decimals yet.
Hopefully planning to add other matrix operations and the support of decimal numbers in the future
